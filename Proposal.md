## Proposal

### Final Project: Mini Game Arcade

Our project is a web-based Mini Game Arcade that features a collection of simple, fun, and interactive games designed for casual play. 
Users can navigate through the arcade homescreen to play games such as Minesweeper, Hangman, Memory Match, and Whack-a-Mole, each implemented with dynamic JavaScript to provide responsive gameplay. 
The arcade includes a persistent scoreboard powered by a database, allowing players to track their high scores across sessions.
Users will be required to login with Github account to be able to store their scores.
This project demonstrates our understanding of web development concepts, including static page design, client-side interactivity, server-side data management, and user experience, 
while giving each group member the opportunity to contribute independently to a distinct game or feature.
